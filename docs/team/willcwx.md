### Project: Team Builder

Team Builder is a desktop personal contacts book application used by the user to form a team for any event. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.  

* **Undo functionality**: 
  * Justification: 
    * Careless Users might want to undo their last command.
    * Rather than finding the reversing action, they can just use `undo`.
    * This is especially useful for users that accidentally use the `clear` command and would like to recover their contact list.

  * Highlights: 
    * Able to undo up to 10 last commands.
    * Able to undo: `add, edit, delete, clear`
  
  * Credits:
    * iP undo implementation (bugs)
    * Momento Design Pattern
