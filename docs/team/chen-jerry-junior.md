### Project: Team Builder

Team Builder is a desktop personal contacts book application used by the user to form a team for any event. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Show Team Feature**
  * Justification:
    * Users might want to list all people under a certain team they created
    * Rather than checking everyone's person card, they can just use `show` followed by the target team name.
    * This is especially useful when users want to compare a team's skill requirements with skills possessed by the members.

  * Highlights:
    * Able to show all members who belong to multiple teams, use `show` followed by names of multiple teams that are separated by spaces.

  * Credits:
    * Unique TeamList Design Pattern
